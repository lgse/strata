# Parity findings

What parity work has found that is not a package's own work: Strata's own bugs and flaky
GTK runs (`oracle`), runs or fuzz sequences where the two targets differ (`divergence`), gaps
in Rune bound for the filing packet (`rune-gap`), requests for a twin or a normalisation rule
(`exception`), and follow-ups to the shared seams. The codes are the labels of the plan's
"Coordination" section, and they keep their meanings.

## Recording a finding

Until 2026-11-12 each finding was a GitHub issue. From now on a new finding is an entry in
this file, added in the pull request that meets it, in the form of the entries below: its
code, two lines on what was seen, the run, seed or test it concerns, and its state. Search
this file by code and by scenario or seed name before adding one. A finding met mid-run may
land as its own small docs-only pull request that merges quickly, so other packages see it
before the package's own pull request does. When a finding is fixed or set aside for good,
its entry says where, and stays.

An `oracle` finding is Strata's own bug, and its fix, if anyone takes it up, lands on `main`.
`main` keeps its own rules, so a fix there still starts from a bug issue on `main`, as
`AGENTS.md` asks; the entry here then links it.

**References.** The ledger's `parallel` entries, a twin's `parity.ref`, and the fuzz driver's
normalisation map, calibration mask and `parked` lists each cite the record behind them, and
their readers accept only two forms: an issue, `lgse/strata#<number>`, or, for a `rune`
twin, its packet entry, `docs/rune/upstream/rune/<number>-<name>.md`
(`tests/qa/twins.rs` and `scripts/qa_parity_check.py` today, and `tests/qa/fuzz/rules.rs`
once F1's pull request [#2181](https://github.com/lgse/strata/pull/2181) merges). References to the archived issues below stay valid and
need no change. What a reference to a finding recorded only in this file looks like is a
question for the owner, the first in [`owner.md`](owner.md#tracking-and-findings): a GitHub
issue for each new finding as its reference, or a `contract` change to the readers to accept
an anchor here. Until it is ruled, a change that needs to cite a new finding says so in its
pull request and in its package's file, and waits.

## Findings

Every archived issue below was closed on GitHub on 2026-11-12 with the package issues. A
closed issue is not a fixed finding: the state given here is the finding's.

### #2161: `cut.patch` no longer applies

- **Code:** `oracle`. [Archived issue](https://github.com/lgse/strata/issues/2161).
- `tests/qa/mutations/cut.patch` no longer applies since `src/ui/browser/clipboard.rs`
  changed under it on `main` ([#2092](https://github.com/lgse/strata/pull/2092)), so nothing proves `cut-moves-only-after-paste` can fail.
- **Concerns:** the GTK mutation patch `cut.patch` and the scenario
  `clipboard/cut-moves-only-after-paste`.
- **State:** open, set aside. `./scripts/qa-parity.sh slice` holds it as the
  `[[stale_patch]]` allowance in `tests/qa/parity/slice.toml` (slice decision 27). The fix,
  if taken up, is a rebase of the patch on `main`.

### #2162: `new-folder-with-selection-groups/columns` is flaky

- **Code:** `oracle`. [Archived issue](https://github.com/lgse/strata/issues/2162).
- After a click on the new folder `grouped`, its column does not take focus within 15 s.
  The run fails more often than it passes alone (1 of 9) and sometimes in the whole suite.
- **Concerns:** the GTK run `entry_management/new-folder-with-selection-groups/columns`.
- **State:** open, set aside. The `[[flaky]]` allowance in `tests/qa/parity/slice.toml` lets
  it fail in `slice`'s whole-suite part. While the allowance names it, its ledger entry can
  be neither `required` nor `parallel`, so [A7](packages/A7.md) cannot close it until the
  flake is fixed on `main` or the owner rules how a flaky oracle is carried.

### #2163: `distant-archive-scrolled-into-view/icons` failed once under load

- **Code:** `oracle`. [Archived issue](https://github.com/lgse/strata/issues/2163).
- In one full run of the suite the archive created off screen was never selected; alone it
  passed 8 of 8, and it has not been seen to fail since.
- **Concerns:** the GTK run `archive_reveal/distant-archive-scrolled-into-view/icons`.
- **State:** open, set aside. It has no allowance: if it fails in `slice`'s whole-suite part,
  `slice` fails.

### #2173: Shift+click on the entry being renamed does two different things

- **Code:** `oracle`. [Archived issue](https://github.com/lgse/strata/issues/2173).
- With the inline rename open on `todo.txt`, a Shift+click on that row clears the field's
  selection in 28 of 34 replays and selects the whole name in 6, from identical input.
- **Concerns:** fuzz seed `0x67` of version 1 of the `calibration` alphabet, found while F1
  calibrated the driver; step 34 of its sequence.
- **State:** open, set aside. Parked in `tests/qa/fuzz/corpus/calibration/parked` in [#2181](https://github.com/lgse/strata/pull/2181),
  and the `calibration` alphabet no longer clicks an entry while a name is edited.

### #2174: a salvaged `settings.toml` gets every default written into it

- **Code:** `oracle`. [Archived issue](https://github.com/lgse/strata/issues/2174).
- A `settings.toml` without `mode` or `theme` is salvaged entry by entry, and the first
  change then saves every default into it, pinning them and overwriting keys another process
  wrote.
- **Concerns:** `salvage_preferences`; pinned by
  `settings::saving::tests::a_salvaged_file_is_saved_with_every_value_loading_filled_in` in
  `strata-desktop`. Found by [B2](packages/B2.md) while building [#2172](https://github.com/lgse/strata/pull/2172).
- **State:** open, set aside. Both interfaces share it by construction since [#2172](https://github.com/lgse/strata/pull/2172) and
  [#2178](https://github.com/lgse/strata/pull/2178); a fix lands on `main` and both follow by merge.

### #2175: timing-sensitive GTK unit tests

- **Code:** `oracle`. [Archived issue](https://github.com/lgse/strata/issues/2175).
- Three GTK unit tests each failed once in CI's shard 1 on a pull request to `strata-next`
  and passed on a rerun of the whole workflow; a fourth failed once on a developer's host.
  Since then: the fourth failed again on a loaded host, once in a run of 417 tests and 1 time
  in 5 alone, on [#2195](https://github.com/lgse/strata/pull/2195); the third failed again in CI's shard 1 on [#2197](https://github.com/lgse/strata/pull/2197), with its recorded
  message; a fifth, a `strata-fs` test with no GTK in it, failed in shard 2 of that same
  run, its search coming back empty. The rerun, where those two passed, failed on a third
  test, which is not a flaky test but a fault of the updater: see "The updater shows
  'Interrupted system call'" below.
- **Concerns:**
  `ui::browser::progress::tests::minimization::deletion::overlapping_fast_deletions_restore_browser_input_after_playback`,
  `ui::window::tests::keyboard_dispatch::direct_commands::shipped_keys_never_reach_the_direct_stage`,
  `ui::window::tests::keyboard_dispatch::pane_focus::default_map_tab_leaves_the_listing_in_one_press`,
  and, added in a comment,
  `ui::window::tests::keyboard_dispatch::folder_jump::tenxer_z_ranks_history_and_opens_the_chosen_folder_once`;
  and, in `strata-fs`,
  `services::search::tests::folder_path_search_leads_with_a_folder_the_query_names_outright`
  (`crates/strata-fs/src/services/search/tests.rs:819`).
- **On [#2181](https://github.com/lgse/strata/pull/2181):** the second failed in CI's shard 1 at `7963d110f` and again in the one
  rerun of the whole workflow, and the third failed in the first of those two runs. That
  change is to the QA runner, its scripts and documentation, and touches no `src/` and no
  crate; `./scripts/quality.sh test` passed at that commit in the pinned image. With
  `strata-next` merged at `734d67f6c`, a sixth,
  `ui::window::tests::keyboard_dispatch::icon_motion::tenxer_icons_move_spatially_open_explicitly_and_peek`,
  failed once in `./scripts/quality.sh test` on a loaded host (`Key(104) landed on ["empty",
  "tile-03.txt", "tile-03.txt"]`) and then passed 6 times of 6 alone.
- **State:** open, set aside. Whoever meets one of these in a red shard reads the failure
  first: if the change could reach the test, it is the change's; if not, say why on the pull
  request, rerun the whole workflow once, and stop if the same test fails twice. A new flaky
  GTK test is added to this entry. When the rerun fails on another test that the
  change cannot reach, as on [#2197](https://github.com/lgse/strata/pull/2197), the orchestrating session's ruling of 2026-11-12 is: record
  the sighting and rerun the whole workflow once more; a test that fails a second time on the
  same pull request stops the agent again.

### #2176: a GTK critical after a file appears during a rename on a multiple selection

- **Code:** `oracle`. [Archived issue](https://github.com/lgse/strata/issues/2176).
- Seven steps (a multiple selection, F2, a file written into the folder, Return, Up, Return)
  make GTK log `gtk_selection_model_selection_changed: assertion … failed`, every time.
- **Concerns:** fuzz seed `0x19b` of version 2 of the `calibration` alphabet, shrunk from 40
  steps to 7 and confirmed 3 of 3.
- **State:** open, set aside. Parked in `tests/qa/fuzz/corpus/calibration/parked` in [#2181](https://github.com/lgse/strata/pull/2181).

### #2177: after Move to Trash on a filtered pane, the preview shows another file

- **Code:** `oracle`. [Archived issue](https://github.com/lgse/strata/issues/2177).
- With the drawer open and the pane filtered, moving `report.md` to the trash from its
  context menu leaves the preview on `todo.txt`, neither focused nor selected, in 23 of 24
  replays, and on the focused entry in the other.
- **Concerns:** fuzz seed `0xb1` of version 2 of the `calibration` alphabet; step 35 of its
  sequence, which did not shrink.
- **State:** open, set aside. Parked in `tests/qa/fuzz/corpus/calibration/parked` in [#2181](https://github.com/lgse/strata/pull/2181).

### #2179: the windowed Rune host does not pump GLib again after a queued update

- **Code:** none of the plan's: a follow-up to the shell's windowed host, labelled `bug`.
  [Archived issue](https://github.com/lgse/strata/issues/2179).
- A GLib source that a queued update attaches (a `spawn_local` task, a timer) is not
  dispatched until the next pump, so a save's result from the shell's own save is heard a
  pump late. Found by reading, in the review of [#2178](https://github.com/lgse/strata/pull/2178); not seen in a running window.
- **Concerns:** `crates/strata-app/src/host/windowed.rs` (`pump`, then `shell::settle`) and
  `crates/strata-platform/src/glib_loop/mod.rs`. The offscreen host does not behave this way.
- **State:** open, not taken up. `shell.rs` and `host/` are the contract's files, so the fix
  is a `contract` pull request, with a test on the windowed host.

### #2180: under load, a click that opens a folder leaves focus in two places

- **Code:** `oracle`. [Archived issue](https://github.com/lgse/strata/issues/2180).
- A click on the folder `pictures` left focus on its column in one replay and on its first
  entry in the other, with the machine loaded four times over. Seen once, in 300 seeds.
- **Concerns:** fuzz seed `0x41c` of version 3 of the `calibration` alphabet; step 2 of its
  sequence. It may share a cause with [#2162](https://github.com/lgse/strata/issues/2162).
- **State:** open, set aside. Parked in `tests/qa/fuzz/corpus/calibration/parked` in [#2181](https://github.com/lgse/strata/pull/2181).

The fuzz issues name their sequence files with the alphabet's version, and those are
the names [#2181](https://github.com/lgse/strata/pull/2181) merges with:
`tests/qa/fuzz/corpus/calibration/fuzz-calibration-v<version>-<seed>.jsonl`, the seed as
sixteen hex digits (`fuzz-calibration-v1-0000000000000067.jsonl` for [#2173](https://github.com/lgse/strata/issues/2173)). A seed names a
sequence only together with the alphabet's version, so the version is part of the name.

### #2193: a GTK test whose name string is stale passes without running

- **Code:** `oracle`. [Issue](https://github.com/lgse/strata/issues/2193), filed on 2026-11-12, before findings moved to
  this file.
- `strata_test_support::isolated_test`, which `gtk_test` wraps, runs a GTK test in a child
  process started with `--exact <name>`, a string the test writes by hand, and asserts only
  that the child exits successfully. With a stale name the child matches no test, exits 0,
  and the test is reported as passed.
- **Concerns:** every test that calls `gtk_test`, `gtk_test_with_env` or `isolated_test`,
  and `crates/strata-test-support/src/lib.rs`. Found by [B2](packages/B2.md) while building
  [#2195](https://github.com/lgse/strata/pull/2195): three tests of a file that had moved passed without running, and the file
  was moved back. Two scans of the name strings, the author's and the reviewer's, found none
  stale then.
- **State:** open, not taken up. Until the harness checks that the child ran its test, a
  move or rename of a test file, module or function takes the name strings with it; in a
  log the only sign is a GTK test printed once and not twice. A fix lands on `main`.

### The updater shows "Interrupted system call" when a signal arrives during a download

- **Code:** `oracle`. No issue: recorded here on 2026-11-12. A fix lands on `main` and starts
  from a bug issue there, which is the owner's to file.
- `IdleLimited::await_input` (`crates/strata-desktop/src/services/update_install/download.rs`)
  waits for the server in slices so that a cancellation is noticed, and hands any error of a
  slice but a timeout up as the download's failure. The wait is a read with a receive
  timeout, which the kernel does not restart after a signal, so a signal that arrives during
  it ends the download with "Could not download signed update metadata: Interrupted system
  call". The GTK application catches `SIGCHLD` through GLib's child watches, so a child
  process that exits during a metadata fetch can show the user that message.
- **Concerns:** the updater on both branches. Seen once in CI, on [#2197](https://github.com/lgse/strata/pull/2197), shard 1 of the
  second attempt of its first run:
  `services::update_install::tests::cancel_stops_a_silent_metadata_fetch_without_waiting_for_a_timeout`
  (`update_install/tests.rs:927`) got that failure where it expected a cancellation. What
  interrupted the read there is not known: nothing in the shared crates installs a signal
  handler, and the test passed 80 of 80 times on a host.
- **State:** open, not taken up, and not to be fixed on `strata-next`. Until it is fixed on
  `main`, the same test can fail a shard; whoever meets it reads the failure, and it is this
  entry and not a new flaky test.

### #2201: Space in a column's sort menu does two different things

- **Code:** `oracle`. [Issue](https://github.com/lgse/strata/issues/2201), filed on 2026-11-12 as the finding's reference and
  closed at once: its state is kept here.
- With a column's sort menu opened from the keyboard (Up, Right, Right, Return) and left
  open, after a right-click and Down, Space puts the folder back in its default order, by
  name, in 16 of 24 replays, and in another order in the other 8. The menu stays open
  either way. The input logs are identical and every step is at rest.
- **Concerns:** fuzz seed `0x1de` of version 3 of the `calibration` alphabet; step 32 of its
  sequence, `{"key":"space"}`, where `app.matches` and `app.menu` differ. The shrinker takes
  the seed from 40 steps to 10 and calls it noise, since the shortest sequence differed in 2
  confirmations of 3. To reproduce:
  `./scripts/qa-fuzz.sh replay tests/qa/fuzz/corpus/calibration/fuzz-calibration-v3-00000000000001de.jsonl --repeats 24 --jobs 1`.
- **State:** open, set aside, parked. Parked in `tests/qa/fuzz/corpus/calibration/parked`
  in [#2181](https://github.com/lgse/strata/pull/2181), with the seed's first 32 steps kept beside it.
